# ClusterComputingWorkshop

I. Introduction
This repo contains written guides, sample shell scripts, and tutorials to teach the skills necessary to begin doing work on a remote machine. This project was started as a workshop for the Pavelsky Global Hydrology Lab at UNC Chapel Hill. While many parts of this are intended as a reference for the EMES River cluster at Chapel Hill, the information provided here is largely applicable to any HPC system on a UNIX OS. In portions where the config on the EMES River Cluster is atypical, I have made an attempt to include the relevant information for a more standard HPC UNIX config. This project is currently a work in progress.

II. Written Guides

There will be several files written in markdown format `example.md`. For example, the first guide in the intended order is `P1_Basics.md`. This contains very basic information about the command line interface, UNIX based operating systems, and connecting to a remote machine using `ssh`. Next in order is `P2_Slurm.md` which, predictably, discusses the SLURM job management system. Further guides added will be given a `P#_Topic.md` format name. 

III. Future work
