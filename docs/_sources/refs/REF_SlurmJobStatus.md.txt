| Code | Status       | Description                                                                                                                   | Common Cause or Example                                                                 |
|------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PD   | Pending       | The job is awaiting resource allocation and has not yet started execution.                                                    | Waiting for resources, partition limits, or job dependencies.                            |
| R    | Running       | The job currently has an allocation and is actively executing on the assigned nodes.                                          | Job is actively running code or computations.                                            |
| CD   | Completed     | The job has successfully terminated all processes on all allocated nodes and completed its execution.                         | Normal completion — program exited cleanly with code 0.                                 |
| F    | Failed        | The job terminated with a non-zero exit code or encountered another failure condition during execution.                       | Script error, segmentation fault, or crash.                                              |
| CG   | Completing    | The job is in the process of completing, but some processes on some nodes may still be active.                                | Cleanup in progress after job termination.                                               |
| CA   | Cancelled     | The job was explicitly cancelled by the user or a system administrator.                                                       | User ran `scancel <jobid>` or dependency job failed.                                     |
| CF   | Configuring   | The job has been allocated resources, but is waiting for them to become ready for use (e.g., booting up).                     | Nodes are powering on or network initialization is pending.                              |
| S    | Suspended     | The job has an allocation, but its execution has been temporarily suspended.                                                  | Admin intervention, system load balancing, or checkpoint/restart testing.                |
| ST   | Stopped       | The job has been stopped, but its cores are retained, unlike a suspended job which releases its cores.                        | Manually paused for debugging or maintenance.                                            |
| TO   | Timeout       | The job reached its allocated time limit and was terminated.                                                                  | Walltime (`#SBATCH -t`) exceeded before job finished.                                    |
| OOM  | Out of Memory | The job terminated due to an out-of-memory error.                                                                             | Process exceeded node memory; increase `--mem` or optimize code.                         |
| NF   | Node Fail     | The job terminated due to the failure of one or more allocated nodes.                                                         | Hardware failure, network outage, or node reboot.                                        |
| PR   | Preempted     | The job was terminated by another job, typically due to a higher priority or resource requirement.                            | Higher-priority user or system reservation took precedence.                              |
